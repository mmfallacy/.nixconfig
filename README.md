# mmfallacy's `.nixconfig`

This repository is my attempt at creating my first very own Nix configuration. Currently, this repository is not used as my daily development driver as I have deployed it in a virtual machine with the intention of further incorporating my [Arch dotfiles](https://github.com/mmfallacy/.dotfiles). This is not intended to be a Nix configuration template but feel free to fork and reuse my configuration structure! ðŸŒŸ

## Structure:

### `./lib`

This directory holds my very own helper functions. Most of the functions inside are documented through comments.

### `./machines`

This folder holds the nixosConfigurations (i.e. configuration for my hosts/machines) that I import in flake.nix Current machines defined:

- `vesperon`: My NixOS VM in VMWare Workstation. I am currently developing this `.nixconfig` here.

### `./packages`

This directory contains my own package sources in case a package I need does not exist yet in any nixpkgs channel.

### `./profiles`

This directory contains user configurations that are system-agnostic. These configurations are imported by a machine's own home.nix entry point (`./machines/<system>/home.nix`). Current profiles defined are:

- `mmfallacy`: This serves as my main user configuration. It composes user modules such as `git`, `zsh`, `starship`, `neovim`, `kitty` to form a base configuration I can extend per system.

### `./system`

This folder holds the system modules (i.e. modules imported and installed system-level) that I use to define my machines.

### `./themes`

This directory houses my theme modules. These modules contains configuration that deal directly with appearances and colors. I use stylix to automate most of the ricing, but I also place appearance related overrides like `ly`'s matrix foreground color, etc.

### `./user`

This folder holds the user modules (i.e. modules imported and installed user-level via `home-manager`) that I use to define my machines.
